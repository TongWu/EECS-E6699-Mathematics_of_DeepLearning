Setting up python:
1. Install Anaconda
2. Install git (if it is not there already) : https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
3. a) Download the GitHub repository for the class into a directory that you will use for the class.
% git clone https://github.com/alizaree/PytorchTut.git
   b) Download the audio files from coursework in the directory that you will use for the class. Unzip. 
4. use Conda to create an environment for the class:
In the terminal, go to the directory and you will now create a python environment for the class
with all the python packages that we’ll be using.
(To understand more about what this is doing:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html. )
There is a “.yml” file in the directory called “make_datamovies_env.yml”
You can run it with this command and it will create and setup the environment and its
dependencies: from terminal cd to the directory of GitHub by the command <<cd ./PytorchTut>> then run the condo common below:
% conda env create -f make_PytorchTut_env.yml
That will take a little while and there will be lots of action in the window...
5. Now to activate the environment and start using the notebooks, there are two ways:
a. In the terminal type:
% conda activate PytorchTut
Run this command first in anaconda prompt

%conda install -c numba numba

and then

%conda install -c conda-forge librosa
then Install pytorch and dependancies use the command below in the activated environment:
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
pip install h5py

Then
Start Jupiter lab:
% jupyterlab
OR
b. Go to your applications and open the Anaconda Navigator, and you’ll see a list of
environments on the main page.. pick Pytorchtut from the list and it should have Jupyterlab
already installed. Launch that!
And open the first notebook !
